<h2>index.html</h2>

<p>
This contains the code for website home page. I use media queries to make the homepage responsive. A mobile user will have
a completley different experience than that of a laptop or desktop user. A mobile user will have an abstract purple design as a background
and use a drop down navigation menu to navigate to other parts of the site. The mobile navigation menu is the same as the navigation
menu used for the 3 other pages. Also to note, an unordered list is used to construct the mobile navigation menu. A laptop or desktop
user will have a large background image of myself in Kotor, Montenegro. Also they will use the custom created navigation menu that
is in the center of the screen. The breakpoints for design changes on the home page are 480px, and 768px.

<h2>travel.html</h2>

<p>
This page presents my interest in traveling. At the top of the page, I have a video I put together of a trip I took through
Central Europe after graduating undergrad in May 2016. Below the video I use 6 1x1 tables to display some of my favorite landscape
pictures I took while on the trip.
</p>

<h2>projects.html</h2>

<p>
This page presents some of the projects I worked on in my engineering career so far. I use bootstrap 4 to create a nicely formatted
3x2 grid system. Each row has one of the three projects, and each row has 2 columns. The first column has a video demo of the project,
and the second column has a title and caption describing the project.
</p>

<h2>about.html</h2>

<p>
My about page is a short bio of myself. It described my career interest and goals, and a little bit about my personal interests.
At the buttom, I have a custom footer that I created using bootstrap 4. Its a 1x3 grid, where each column in the row is an icon that
links to my linkedin, github, and instagram respectivley.

<h2>styles.scss and styles.css</h2>

<p>
Styles.scss and styles.css have a very tight relationship. I used styles.scss to write my code in SASS to take advantage of
SASS features such as variables, inheritence, and nesting. Prior to testing, or launching the website in the browser, I compiled
my SASS file into my CSS file to generate the raw CSS. Overall, the purpose of styles.scss and styles.css is to style my website
in addition to the default bootstrap styling. My SASS file contains class, id, element, pseudoclass, and pseudoelement selectors.
It also meets or exceeds the remaining SASS requirements.
